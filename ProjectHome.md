# Summary #
**[OpenSauce for HaloCE, V3.1, Released!](http://www.halomods.com/ips/index.php?/topic/6-open-sauce-halo-custom-edition/page__st__200__gopid__7615#entry7615)** (only supports v1.09 of HaloCE).

**`OpenSauce` for `Halo2_Xbox`: _Discontinued_**

"`OpenSauce`" is a collection of projects (both C++ and .NET based) produced by Kornner Studios that have been used in development of Project "Yelo".

These releases were built from the ground up, with open source in mind, so their code may or may not reflect the original codebase from which they were derived from due to security, IP (intellectual property), and various other concerns.

See the [Licensing](Licensing.md) page for general and exemption information.

We now have an [ohloh page](https://www.ohloh.net/p/open-sauce).

We're on [Halopedia](http://www.halopedian.com/OpenSauce).

Community announcements on the project can most likely [be found here](http://www.halomods.com/ips/index.php?/topic/6-open-sauce-halo-custom-edition/)

**NOTE** This code is not supported or endorsed in ANY WAY by Bungie, Wideload Games, Microsoft, Microsoft Game Studios, or Gearbox Software.
