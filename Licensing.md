# Introduction #

Currently, `OpenSauce` is licensed under GPLv3. The main reasoning behind this is to force the community to share derivative works.

Another major bullet is the fact that the engine extensions (eg, OS for Halo1\_CE) don't allow for additional plugins. So a third party can't create their own special little modification and have it plug into the existing engine extension binary. The codebase is far too developed to mold it into something that _could_ support such functionality.

Due to the fact that the Blam engine is a closed source system to multiple games, everyone benefits from shared research.

Sometimes, people create really cool food based on different mixtures of other's recipes. The same goes for code. With all derived works requiring source modifications to be released, we can see if there are things which we would like to see integrated into the main source tree of `OpenSauce` (a good example was the Postprocessing render modifications for Halo1\_CE).


# Exemptions #

There are two ways to be exempted from any facets of the GPL license currently used:
  * You were originally a developer for an official Blam engine based game (namely, Bungie). Without you, this codebase would not be, so feel free to do as you please with what you see or what you do.
  * You provide enough reason to Kornner Studios for why your modifications should be exempt from public source sharing.

What would be a good reason for gaining exemption? If in case you're developing new networking or cheat detection code which requires algorithms to be kept under wraps.


# Conclusion #

The Blam engine is a fracking fun engine to play with. As gamers and modders alike, everyone should have the same chance to play within the same sandbox as long as such playing isn't wrecking the good times of others. The Halo modding community doesn't have the resources found in other engine communities (say, Source engine) where there is official documentation and tools (well, some Halo games come with _some_ of said things...but their usefulness is debatable). So we're left to work with each other to make our own tools for an existing sandbox.
