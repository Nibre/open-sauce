User of OS for HaloCE? Have questions or problems? Check the list below before venturing off and nagging others for common problems with common solutions


# Installation #

## Does OS Auto-update? ##

  * No, OS has no auto-update features

## The MSI fails to install OS ##

  * The installer requires Admin rights because it modifies Program Files and the like. Run it with such or just go play a different game.
  * Reinstall HaloCE + the HEK. Chances are you didn't do it right the first time.
  * Update HaloCE (including the dedicated server) to the supported version (v1.09)

# Running OS In-game #

## Games crashes at startup ##

  * Turn off programs ALL other programs and try again.
  * Especially turn off Xfire. See [Issue 4](http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/issues/detail?id=4&can=1). Open the task manager and make sure that fucker isn't running still. Yes, the shitty software likes to persist in memory even after you tell it to "quit".
  * Update your game and dedi exes to the supported version (v1.09)
  * If you "upgraded" from an older OS install (e.g., 3.0.1 to 3.0.3), try uninstalling your current install and then reinstall with the most up to date version.

## In-game menu disappears instantly ##

  * Chances are you're running Steam. See [Issue 6](http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/issues/detail?id=6&can=1). This is Valve problem, not ours or Halo's.

## WTF is this blur stuff? ##

  * Motion blur is on by default. Turn it off via the in-game console by [setting this global](http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/wiki/Doc_Halo1_NewScriptInterfaces#pp_motion_blur_enabled) to false.


# Using the OS HEK #

**TBD**
