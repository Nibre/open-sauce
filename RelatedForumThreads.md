Originally, we had a thread with a poll in reworked's Halo 2 Xbox section asking how many people still had modded Xbox1s and/or Xbox1 devkits. Around August 2010 reworked's forum DB went 'kaput'. They had a backup which they eventually restored to the site however, our thread was made after the last backup was made and thus lost.
